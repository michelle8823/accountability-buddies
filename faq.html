               automatically cancelled. You will then be sent another email to
               be matched with other buddies.
            </p>
            <h2>Can I choose more than one buddy?</h2>
            <p>Yes you can. However, you can only have one buddy per goal for now.
               Whoever accepts your request first will be your buddy.          
            </p>
            <h2>What information will be provided to my buddy?</h2>
            <p>Only your name and email address will be provided. We expect you
